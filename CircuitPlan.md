## 🎯 **CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS** (2025-09-09)

### **What We Have Built**

The Circuit Editor has been successfully implemented as a **React-based drag-and-drop workflow builder** with the following features:

#### **🚩 Core Achievements**
- ✅ **Full ReactFlow Integration**: Professional drag-and-drop canvas with zoom, pan, and minimap
- ✅ **Interactive Connectors**: Color-coded input/output handles with visual feedback
- ✅ **Dynamic Block Heights**: Blocks automatically expand to accommodate multiple connectors
- ✅ **Complete CRUD Operations**: Create, save, load, and delete circuits with Zustand state management
- ✅ **Professional UI**: Integrated as overlay in main chat interface (Circuits button in header)

#### **🎨 Visual Editor Features**

**Block Types Currently Implemented:**
- ⚡ **Logic Block**: 1 input, 1 output - for basic connection workflows
- 📖 **Content Block**: 2 inputs, 1 output - for text processing and content routing
- ↗️ **Flow Block**: 1 input, 2 outputs - for conditional branching (next/alternate paths)
- 🔗 **Integration Block**: 2 inputs, 3 outputs - comprehensive API and external integration support

**Additional Blocks:**
- **Basic Text Block**  
This block is for basic text input. It outputs a string.  The user may type in any string into this block's settings to be output. This block can have it's label changed by the user in the circuits editor to help identify it's purpose.
  - No Inputs
  - 1 Output (str)
  - Example Use: Set the value in settings to "You are a helpful Assistant." and change label to Basic System Prompt for the most basic ai chat setup.

- **Boolean Block**  
This block will compare the two inputs. If they're equal the top TRUE output will pass on the input and the bottom FALSE output will be null. If they're not equal then the bottom FALSE output will pass on the Top Input and the top TRUE output will be null.
   - 2 Inputs (Main and comparison)
   - 2 Outputs (top output is corresponds with TRUE bottom output with FALSE)  

        **Example Use:**  
        *True Example:*
        ```
            Mickey Mouse --> {Input 1}[Boolean]{Output 1} --> Mickey Mouse
            Mickey Mouse --> {Input 2}[ Block ]{Output 2} -->
        ```
        *False Example:*
        ```
            Mickey Mouse --> {Input 1}[Boolean]{Output 1} --> 
            Donald Duck  --> {Input 2}[ Block ]{Output 2} --> Mickey Mouse
        ```  

- **Switch Block**  
 This block only outputs it's input when it receives a non-null signal on it's signal input.
    - 2 Inputs (input and signal)
    - 1 Output (output)

        **Positive Signal Examples:**  
        ```
         Hello --> {Input 1}[Switch]{Output} -->  Hello
            1  -->  {Signal}[Block ]

        -or-

         Hello       --> {Input 1}[Switch]{Output} -->  Hello
         Some String -->  {Signal}[Block ]

        ```
        **null Signal Example:**
        ```

         Hello       --> {Input 1}[Switch]{Output} -->  
                     -->  {Signal}[Block ]
        ```
- **Format: Persona**  
This block can output data from the User Persona.  It contains a User name output and a description output.
    - 0 Inputs
    - 2 Outputs (User Name and Description)

        **Example:**
        ```
        [Persona]{User Name Output} --> Aaron
        [ Block ]{Description Output} --> 38 year old tall lanky man
        ```
- **Character: Currently Selected Character**  
This block just outputs the name and unique id of the currently selected (active) character. It's mainly used to feed into the other character blocks.
    - 0 Inputs
    - 2 Outputs (Charcter and character id)

        **Example:**
        ```
        [Character]{Character Output} --> Seraphina
        [  Block  ]{character id Output} --> 3
        ```

- **AI Command**  
This block accepts text input (textinput) and a prompt (promptinput) and sends it to the AI. When the AI replies it outputs that reply (output)
    - 2 Inputs (textinput and promptinput)
    - 1 Outputs (output)

        **Example:**
        ```
                            [Character Description Output] --> {textinput}[AI Command]{output} --> "A tall statuesque gentleman with a powdered wig..."
        "Summarize only the visual aspects of this character" --> {prompt}[   Block  ]
        ```

- **Character: Description**  
This block outputs the description field from the character card of the matching character id from the input
    - 1 Input (character id)
    - 1 Outputs (description)

        **Example:**
        ```
        1 --> {character id}[Character Description]{Description Output} --> The first President of the United States, a tall and imposing figure...
                            [       Block         ]
        ```


**Connector System:**
- 🟢 **Input Connectors** (Left side, Green): "input1", "text", "source", "request", "trigger"
- 🟠 **Output Connectors** (Right side, Orange): "output", "result", "next", "branched", "success", "error", "response"
- 📏 **Dynamic Sizing**: Blocks grow from 100px minimum to accommodate connections
- 🎯 **Visual Feedback**: Hover tooltips on connectors, visible handles, professional styling

#### **🛠️ Technical Implementation**

**Frontend Architecture:**
- **ReactFlow Library**: Professional node-based editor with full customization
- **Zustand State**: Circuit persistence and management
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety for all circuit operations
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of block types and connector configurations

**UI Integration:**
- **Header Button**: "Circuits" in main toolbar opens overlay editor
- **Fullscreen Canvas**: 400px height canvas with controls and minimap
- **Block Palette**: Drag-and-drop sidebar with all available block types
- **Properties Panel**: Circuit info, connection counts, node management
- **Inline Documentation**: Commented usage instructions throughout the code

#### **🔄 User Workflow**
1. **Access**: Click "Circuits" button in main chat interface header
2. **Create**: Click "+ New Circuit" to start building circuits
3. **Build**: Drag blocks from palette onto canvas, connect with drag-and-drop
4. **Manage**: Use delete key or button to remove blocks, name, and save circuits
5. **Persist**: All circuits saved automatically via API and loaded on refresh

#### **🎯 Known Limitations (Ready for Development)**
- **Backend Execution**: Frontend UI complete, backend logic flow not yet implemented
- **Block Logic**: All block types visual, but processing logic needs development
- **Validation**: Visual validation, but runtime circuit validation not implemented
- **Advanced Features**: Conditional processing, variable management, templates pending

### **Implementation Timeline**
- ✅ **Phase 1**: UI/UX Design and ReactFlow Integration (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Full Connector System with Color Coding (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Block Management and Persistence (COMPLETED)
- ⏳ **Phase 3.2**: Additional Blocks (NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASE)
- ⏳ **Phase 4**: Backend Logic Implementation (Future Enhancement)
- ⏳ **Phase 5**: Advanced Features (Future Enhancement)

### **Next Development Steps**
The visual foundation is now complete and ready for:
1. **Circuit Logic Engine**: Backend processing to execute circuits
2. **Real Block implementations**: Actually process data through blocks
3. **Prompt Integration**: Connect circuits to chat prompt building
4. **Advanced Validation**: Runtime circuit checking and error handling
