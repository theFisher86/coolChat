## 🎯 **CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS** (2025-09-12)

### **What We Have Built**

The Circuit Editor has been successfully implemented as a **modal-integrated prompt builder** with the following features:

#### **🚩 Core Achievements**
- ✅ **Modal Integration**: Professional modal overlay in main chat interface
- ✅ **Interactive Connectors**: Color-coded input/output handles with visual feedback
- ✅ **Dynamic Block Heights**: Blocks automatically expand to accommodate multiple connectors
- ✅ **Complete CRUD Operations**: Create, save, load, and delete circuits with Zustand state management
- ✅ **Professional UI**: Integrated as overlay in main chat interface (Circuits button in header)

#### **🎨 Visual Editor Features**

**Block Types Currently Implemented:**
- ⚡ **Logic Block**: 1 input, 1 output - for basic connection workflows
- 📖 **Content Block**: 2 inputs, 1 output - for text processing and content routing
- ↗️ **Flow Block**: 1 input, 2 outputs - for conditional branching (next/alternate paths)
- 🔗 **Integration Block**: 2 inputs, 3 outputs - comprehensive API and external integration support
- **Basic Text Block**: No inputs, 1 output - for basic text input that outputs a string

**Connector System:**
- 🟢 **Input Connectors** (Left side, Green): "input1", "text", "source", "request", "trigger"
- 🟠 **Output Connectors** (Right side, Orange): "output", "result", "next", "branched", "success", "error", "response"
- 📏 **Dynamic Sizing**: Blocks grow from 100px minimum to accommodate connections
- 🎯 **Visual Feedback**: Hover tooltips on connectors, visible handles, professional styling

#### **🛠️ Technical Implementation**

**Frontend Architecture:**
- **ReactFlow Library**: Professional node-based editor with full customization
- **Zustand State**: Circuit persistence and management
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety for all circuit operations
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of block types and connector configurations

**UI Integration:**
- **Modal Design**: Circuit editor opens in modal overlay
- **Manual Execution**: Circuits executed manually through UI controls
- **Header Button**: "Circuits" in main toolbar opens modal editor
- **Fullscreen Canvas**: 400px height canvas with controls and minimap
- **Block Palette**: Drag-and-drop sidebar with core block types
- **Properties Panel**: Circuit info, connection counts, node management

#### **🔄 User Workflow**
1. **Access**: Click "Circuits" button in main chat interface header
2. **Create**: Click "+ New Circuit" to start building circuits
3. **Build**: Drag blocks from palette onto canvas, connect with drag-and-drop
4. **Execute**: Manually execute circuits through UI controls
5. **Manage**: Use delete key or button to remove blocks, name, and save circuits
6. **Persist**: All circuits saved automatically via API and loaded on refresh

#### **🎯 Simplified Circuit Usage**

Circuits are now simplified to focus on manual prompt building and workflow management. The 5 core blocks provide essential functionality for creating custom AI interaction workflows without over-engineering. Users can build modular prompt chains and execute them manually to generate customized AI responses.

#### **🎯 Known Limitations**
- **Manual Execution**: Circuits require manual triggering, no automatic execution
- **Simplified Logic**: Only basic block types implemented, advanced logic pending
- **No Backend Processing**: Frontend UI complete, backend execution not implemented
- **Limited Validation**: Basic visual validation, no runtime circuit validation

### **Implementation Timeline**
- ✅ **Phase 1**: UI/UX Design and ReactFlow Integration (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Full Connector System with Color Coding (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Block Management and Persistence (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **Phase 3.1**: Circuit Simplification and Archiving (COMPLETED)
- ⏳ **Phase 4**: Backend Logic Implementation (Future Enhancement)
- ⏳ **Phase 5**: Advanced Features (Future Enhancement)

### **Next Development Steps**
The simplified foundation is now complete and ready for:
1. **Circuit Logic Engine**: Backend processing to execute circuits
2. **Enhanced Block implementations**: Expand core block functionality
3. **Prompt Integration**: Connect circuits to chat prompt building
4. **Advanced Validation**: Runtime circuit checking and error handling
