## ~~3. User Experience & Interface (UI/UX)~~ â†’ **DE-PRIORITIZED**
*Note: Standard UI/UX improvements remain secondary after prompt manager implementation.*

## 3. Prompt Manager & Circuits System
### 3.1 New "Prompt Manager" concept
- Introduction: A flowchart-based UI for managing all prompts, variables, and logic blocks in a visual editor.
--circuits: Drag-and-drop interface allowing users to create complex prompt workflows with if/then/else blocks, random choice blocks, OR/XOR/NOR blocks, random number blocks, random choice from list blocks, counter blocks, variable blocks (from Settings->Prompts->Variables), general prompts, system prompts, placeholders, and ANY other prompt or content sent to the AI.
- Integration: Circuits will replace hardcoded prompt construction, allowing full user customization of AI interactions.

### 3.2 Enhanced Testing & Validation Focus
- Shift primary focus to comprehensive testing and validation of lorebooks and prompt injection systems.
- Ensure all prompt, variable, and text strings identified in the catalog below function correctly within circuits.

### 3.3 System Prompt Extension
- Add user-editable fields for previously non-editable text sent to AI:
  - **Persona Format**: Template for user persona inclusion (e.g., "User Persona: {name}\n{description}")
  - **Tool Descriptions Format**: Descriptive text for tool capabilities
  - **Lore Injection Format**: Format for injecting lore entries (e.g., "[{keyword}] {content}")
  - **Active Lore Title**: Title for active/global lore sections

## 3. User Experience & Interface (UI/UX)

### 3.1 Modern UI/UX Refresh
**Problem:** The current UI is functional but could benefit from a more modern and polished design.
**Recommendation:** Conduct a comprehensive UI/UX review and implement improvements.

*   **Improvement:** Adhere to WCAG guidelines for accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, color contrast).

### 3.3 Frontend State Management
**Problem:** Direct API calls and `useState` for complex state might become unwieldy.
**Recommendation:** Introduce a more robust state management solution.
*   **Improvement:** Implement a centralized state management library (e.g., Zustand, React Context with `useReducer`) to manage global application state more effectively.
*   **Improvement:** Refactor API calls into dedicated service modules or custom React hooks.

### 3.4 ~~Theming and Customization~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Problem:** Theming is present but could be more flexible.
**Recommendation:** Expand theming options and user customization.
*   **Feature:** âœ… Allow users to create, save, and share custom themes more easily.

*   **Feature:** One-click installation and uninstallation of extensions.
*   **Feature:** Automatic updates for extensions.

## 6. Strategic Considerations
### 6.1 RAG Implementation Timing
**Consideration:** While RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) remains valuable for performance improvements, evaluate whether it should precede prompt manager work. Key factors:
- Prompt manager/circuits will require extensive testing of current prompt injection systems first.
- RAG may conflict with or duplicate prompt manager functionality.
- Prioritize prompt manager as the foundation for all AI interactions, then assess RAG integration needs.
